# LightMaster

Sample I2C master implementation for testing PIC software controling a LED ring.

## Setup

The sources are delivered in the form of a MPLAB X project. Building should be as easy as hitting build.

## Hardware

The software is tested to work with the PIC16LF1829. It should work on similar processors.
